One of the languages I speak is Italian, I am not completely fluent on that
language but I am constantly learning it, here you can find all the notes I have
taken while learning it, you will find grammar, vocabulary and all that stuff.

The contents of "Italian" are splitten in four different levels:

* A1
* A2
