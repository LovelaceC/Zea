As you may remember, in Italian, verbs are divided into three main groups
according to the ending of the infinitive (its most basic form): **-are**,
**-ere**, **-ire**. In this unit you'll get the change to practise some new
verbs.

A quick reminder: To conjugate a regular verb you have to remove the
ending (are, ere, ire) from the infinite and add the corresponding ending
depending on who is performing the action. Let's start with -**are** verbs.
Below is the verb "guardare" (to look) as an example:

- io guard-**o**
- tu guard-**i**
- lui / lei guard-**a**
- noi guard-**iamo**
- voi guard-**ate**
- loro guard-**ano**

"-Ere" and "-ire" verbs take the same endings with all pronunciations except for
"voi". You can see the difference below, with the verbs "vedere" (to see) and
"dormire" (to sleep):

| Subject Pronouns | "-ere" verb | "-ire" verb |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| io               | ved-**o**   | dorm-**o**  |
| tu               | ved-**i**   | dorm-**i**  |
| lui/lei          | ved-**e**   | dorm-**e**  |
| noi              | ved-**iamo** | dorm-**iamo** |
| voi              | ved-**ete** | dorm-**ite** |
| loro             | ved-**ono** | dorm-**ono** |

As you might already know, for some "**-ire**" verbs we need to add **-isc-** in
between the stem and the regular ending when using the forms "io", "tu",
"lui / lei" and "loro". The endings remain the same. Here are some verbs tha
work like this: "pulire" (to clean) and "preferire" (to prefer). Have a look
at the conjugations of "pulire" below:

- io pul-**isc**-o
- tu pul-**isc**-i
- lui / lei pul-**isc**-e
- noi pul-iamo
- voi pul-ite
- loro pul-**isc**-ono
