# Direct object pronouns - A1 - Italian

Until now, we have mostly seen personal pronouns (io, tu, lui, lei, noi, voi, loro)
being used before a verb. When used in this way, they take the role of a subject
pronoun: the thing of person that does the action.

- **Tu** cucini molto bene.
- **Noi** ascoltiamo la musica.

Sometimes, after the verb web find a direct objetc. The direct object is the thing
or person who "directly receives" the action, and can be identified by asking
n**who** or **what**. It usually goes after the verb. Have a look at these sentences:

- Tu leggi **un libro** tutte le sere
  You read **a book** every evening
- Noi vediamo **la mia amica** sabato
  We're seeing my friend on saturday

In Italian, we can replace the direct object with a **direct object pronoun** if we
want to avoid saying or repeating the direct object. This pronoun **goes before
the verb**. Since it acts as a direct object, it can be used only with a transitive
verb (a verb that can be followed by an object, such as "leggere" and "vedere").

- Tu leggi un libro - Tu **lo** leggi
- Noi vediamo la mia amica - Noi **la** vediamo

These are the singular direct object pronouns:

mi: Tu mi vedi (You see me)
ti: lo ti vedo (I see you)
lo: Voi lo vedete (You see him / it)
la: Voi la vedete (You see her / it)

These are the plural direct object pronouns:

ci: Loro ci vedono (They see us)
vi: Noi vi vediamo (We see you - plural)
li: Io li vedo (I see them)
le: Tu le vedi (You see them)
