A simple way of identifying the gender of a noun is by looking at the article
that precedes it. In Italian, the singular definite articles are "**il, lo, la,
l'**". We uuse "**il**" and "**lo**" with masculine nouns, and "**la**" with
feminine nouns. When a noun starts with a vowel, we use the article "**l'**"
for both feminine and masculine.

Masculine:
- Il ragazzo
- Lo stivale
- L'ombrello

Feminine:
- La donna
- La sedia
- L'isola

Usually, nouns that end with **-o** are masculine, while nouns that end with
**-a** are feminine. Nouns that end in **-e** can be both, so you'll have to
remember the gender when you learn the word! Have a look at the examples below:

Masculine:
- Il vino
- Il gatto
- Il mare

Feminine:
- La pasta
- La festa
- La voce

As we know, there are sometimes exceptions to rules. Here are some of them:

Feminine nouns that end in **-o**:
- La mano
- La radio
- La foto

Masculine nouns that end in **-a**:
- Il cinema
- Il problema

The three rules below will also help you recognise the gender of words:

- Nouns that end in a consonant (usually foreign words) are almost always
masculine: il bar, il toast, lo yogurt, etcetera.

- Letters of the alphabet that are always feminine: **la** b, **la** m, **la** r

- All cities, regardless of their ending, are feminine: Roma, Venezia, Firenze (
But be careful, we do not use an article in front of names of cities or towns)
