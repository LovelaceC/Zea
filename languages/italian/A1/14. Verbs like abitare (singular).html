We've seen how to use the verb "**abitare**" to say where we live.

This lesson, we'll learn how to build similar verbs such as "**parlare**" (to
talk) and "**lavorare**" (to work).

We learned that to use a verb correctly we first need to **drop the final three
letters** (are-). The part of the word that is left is called the **stem** and
it doesn't change.

| Verb | Stem |
| ---- | ---- |
| abit**are** | abit- |
| parl**are** | parl- |
| lavor**are** | lavor- |

To use a verb correctly, we need to **add a new ending to the end of a stem**.
The new ending depends on who we are talking about.

| Personal pronoun | Stem + ending |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| io               | abito, parlo, lavoro |
| tu               | abiti, parli, lavori |

Example:

- Lavoro a Firenze
  I work in Florence
- Dove lavori?
  Where do you work?
- Parli l'italiano molto bene!
  You speak Italian very well!

To build the verb forms for "**lui**" and "**lei**", we need to add an "**-a**"
to the stem. The forst for "lui" and "lei" are always identical.

| Personal pronoun | Stem + ending |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| lui, lei         | abit**a**, parl**a**, lavor**a** |

| Personal pronoun | abitare, parlare, lavorare |
| io               | abit**o**, parl**o**, lavor**o** |
| tu               | abit**i**, parl**i**, lavor**i** |
| lui, lei         | abit**a**, parl**a**, lavor**a** |
