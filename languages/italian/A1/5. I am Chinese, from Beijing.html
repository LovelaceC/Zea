# I am Chinese, from Beijing -  A1 - Italian

We learned that for some nationalities in Italian there are two words. One for
men and other for women.

american**o** / american**a**
tedesc**o** / tedesc**a**

However, with other nationalities engine in **-ese**, such as **francese**
(french), we use the same for both men and women.

Let's look at some examples:

| Italian | Meaning |
| Francese | French |
| Cinese | Chinese |
| Inglese | English |

There is no specific rule why some adjectives have two forms (such as
americano/americana), whereas others only have one (such as cinese)

You'll learn to recognise and memorise them as we progress in the course, but
for now, look up any you can't remember! You'll always find the male form listed
in a dictionary (for example american**o** and cines**e**)
