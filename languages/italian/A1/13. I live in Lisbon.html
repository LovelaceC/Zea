In this lesson weÃ ll learn how to use a key verb in italian: "abitare" to live.

| Italian | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Abitare | To live | Abito a Lisbona |

To ask somebody where do they live, you can ask "Dove abiti?"

The vern "abitare" changes depending on who we are talking about.

- io goes with abito. Io abito a Lisbon
- tu goes with abiti. Tu dove abiti?

You can build the verb forms of "abitare" in two easy steps.

1. Remove the three final letters ("-are"). The part of the word that is left is
called the **stem** and it doesn't change.

    **abitare** -> stem: **abit-**

2. At the end of the stem ("**abit-**"), add the correct ending ("**o**" or
"**i**") for the person you are talking about.

| Personal pronoun | Stem of "abitare" + ending |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| io               | abit + **o**               |
| tu               | abit + **i**               |

Finally, we use this structure to say what city we line in: "**Abito**" (I live)
+ "**a**" (in) + the name of the city.

- Abito **a** Dublino (I live in Dublin)
- Abito **a** Seul (I live in Seoul)
