Now, we'll learn about the **four indefinite articles** (**un**, **uno**,
**un'**, **una**). Why?

Because they help us understand the gender of nouns, so we can start
building lots of sentences in Italian.

We learned that **most masculine** nouns end with the letter "**o**" whereas
**most feminine** nouns end with the letter **a**.

Some common masculine and feminine nouns do not end with "**o**" or "**a**".

For example, tiramis√π (the Italian dessert) is masculine and stazione
(station) is feminine.

In many sentences, we can tell the gender of a noun by looking at its
article, or in other words, the short word that comes just before the noun.

- Masculine: Vorrei **un** panino
- Feminine: Vorrei **una** birra

We'll study the difference between these articles later on.

For now, all you need remember is their gender.

Masculine: uno, un
Feminine: una, un'
