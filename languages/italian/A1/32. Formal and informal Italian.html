# Formal and informal Italian -  A1 - Italian

You approach a police officer to ask for information. You greet him with _Ciao!_
but looks confused... almost angry! You wonder what's going on.

In this lesson, we'll learn about a very important aspect of **italian culture**
: The difference between **formal** and **informal** language.

We use the **formal** pronoun "**Lei**" to **be polite** when we talk to a man
or a woman. We use it very often, for instance when we write or talk to:

- A government official
- A person the same age as us or older that we don't know well
- A stranger
- A professional (doctor, teacher, shop assitant, etcetera)

Sometimes it's not easy to understand which one to use. When in doubt, use the
formal **Lei**.

It is generally the older or higher-ranking person who will allow you the use
of "**tu**" by saying "**diamoci del tu**" - broadly meaning "_Let's use the
tu_".

We often capitalise "**Lei**" in official documents to distinguish it more
clearly from "**lei**" (she).

We use the verb forms for both Lei and lei.

| Personal pronoun | Essere | Lavorare |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Tu               | Sei    | Lavori   |
| Lei / lei        | Ã¨      | Lavora   |

In **formal** situations, we cannot use "ciao". Instead, we can say
**buongiorno** (good morning), **buon pomeriggio** (good afternoon)
and after 6-7 pm **buonasera** (good evening).

Finally, to apologise or to get someone's attention, we say **scusa**
(tu, informal) or **scusi** (Lei, formal).
