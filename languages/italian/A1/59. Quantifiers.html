# Quantifiers - A1 - Italian

In this unit we are going to learn about **indefinite adjectives of quantity**.
These adjectives express a non-specific quantity and can be used with both
countable and uncountable nouns. Have a look at the examples below:

- Hai **abbastanza** zucchero per fare la torta?
  Do you have enough sugar to make the cake?

- Mi servono **tante** carote per questa ricetta
  I need a lot of carrots for this recipe

- Abbiamo **poco** latte, puoi andare a comprarlo?
  We have little milk left, can you go and buy some?

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Poco | Little (of something) |
| Molto / Tanto | A lot |
| Troppo | Too much / Too many |
| Abbastanza | Enough |

As you might hav noticed, the adjectives have to **match in gender and number**
with the noun they describe, hance the different forms in the keyphrases. "Poco"
"molto", "tanto" and "troppo" have different forms. "Abbastanza", however, has
only one form.

- Masculine singular: poco, molto, tanto, troppo
- Masculine plural: pochi, molti, tanti, troppi
- Feminine singular: poca, molta, tanta, troppa
- Feminine plural: poche, molte, tante, troppe
