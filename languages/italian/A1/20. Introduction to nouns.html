As in many other languages, in italian all nouns (words indicating people,
animals, and objects) have a gender, meaning that they are either masculine
or feminine.

- Masculine: uomo (man), gatto (cat)
- Feminine:  donna (woman), birra (beer)

Most masculine nouns end with the letter "**o**" whereas most feminine nouns
end with the letter "**a**".
