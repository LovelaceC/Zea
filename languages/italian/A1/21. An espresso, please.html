# An espresso, please - A1 - Italian

Where do Italians go to have a coffe, a quick lunch or an evening aperitif? They
go to a "**bar**", a small and casual place, open early morning till late
evening.

| Italian | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Un caffè | An espresso | Un caffè, per favore. |
| Un cornetto | A croissant | Vorrei un corneto. |

Espreso is the default coffe in Italy, so to order one just ask for a "**cafè**"

We can start an order by saying "**vorrei**" or if we are with other people by
saying "**per me**" (for me).

To sound polite, we can finish the sentence with "**per favore**" or
"**grazie**".
