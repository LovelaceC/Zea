| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Pagare con la carta | To pay by card |
| Pagare in contanti | To pay with cash |

In Italy, it's not very common to pay small accounts by card. In small shops or
less touristy areas, you might see a sign saying **solo contanti** (cash only).

If you find yourself short on cash, you can say **Posso pagare con la carta?** (
can I pay by card)

In Italy, the word bancomat has two meanings: It refers to an ATM and it is used
as generic term for debit cards.

- C'Ã¨ un **bancomat** qui vicino?
  Is there an ATM nearby?
- Posso pagare con il bancomat?
  Can I pay by debit card?

| Lo scontrino | The receipt |

In Italian coffe shops you might see a sign saying **Fare prima lo scontrino
alla cassa** (Get the receipt at the cast desk first)

Once you have your receipt, you can move over to the bar and give it to the
barista to make your order.
