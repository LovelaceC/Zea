# The verb andare - A1 - Italian

If you want to talk about going somewhere, or invite someone to come with you,
you need to use the verbs "**andare**" (to go) and "**venire**" (to come).
These are **irregular** verbs, which means they follow different patterns.

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Andare | To go |
| Io vado | I go |
| Tu vai | You go |
| Lui / lei va | He/she goes |
| Noi andiamo | We go |
| Voi andate | You (plural) go |
| Loro vanno | They go |

Now let's have a look at the verb "venire". Unlike "andare", it refers to the
movement towards the person we are speaking to, or someone's movement towards
us.

Venire: **Tu vieni** a casa mia? (Are you coming to my place?)
        This implies that I will be home when you come

Andare: **Tu vai** a casa mia? (are you going to my place?)
        This implies that I will not be home when you come

Venire: **Io vengo** al cinema stasera (I am coming to the cinema tonight)
        This implies that I am going with the person I am talking to

Andare: **Io vado** al cinema stasera. (I am going to the cinema tonight)
        This implies that the person I am talking to is not coming with me

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Venire | To come |
| Io vengo | I come |
| Tu vieni | You come |
| Lui / lei viene | He / she comes |
| Noi veniamo | We come |
| Voi venite | You (plural) come |
| Loro vengono | They come |

We can also use the verb "venire" to say where we come from:

Io vengo dalla Colombia, e tu da dove vieni?
I come from Colombia, where do you come from?
