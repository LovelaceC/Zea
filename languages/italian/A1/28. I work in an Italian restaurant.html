You've just learned how to say what you do for a living. Now, let's learn how to
talk about where we work and how long we've had our jobs.

- Sono un'insegnante, lovo in una scuola elementare
  I am a teaching, I work in an elementary school
- Lavoro in un ospedale da sei anni
  I've been working in a hospital for six years

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Un negozio | A shop |
| Un ufficio | An office |

To ask someone how long they have been working in their current role we use the
phrase "**Da quanto tempo**" followed by the **present tense**. To answer this
question we can sei "**da... mesi/anni**" (for... months/years). Have a look at
the dialogue below between Stella and her uncle Nicola:

- Nicola: **Da quanto tempo lavori** in questo negozio?
- Stella: **Lavoro** qui **da** sei mesi. E tu?
- Nicola: Io non lavoro, **sono** pensionato **da** un anno.
