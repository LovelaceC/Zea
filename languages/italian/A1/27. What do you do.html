# What do you do? - A1 - Italian

As in many other countries, work is a common topic for small talk when starting
a friendly conversation in Italy. In this lesson we are going to learn some
useful expressions as well as the male and female forms of some common job
titles.

- Sono un'insegnante (I'm a teacher)
- Sei iun infermiere? (Are you a nurse?)

To ask someone what they do for a living we can say "Che lavoro fai?". We use
the verb "**essere**" followed by the article and occupation. Have a look at the
mini-dialogue between Caterina and Matteo.

- Catterina: Che lavoro fai? (What do you do?)
- Matteo: Sono un operaio (I am a factory worker)
