To build the forms of regular verbs such as "lavorare" we first need, as usual,
to drop the last 3 letters "-are". Then, we add to the stem ("lavor-") the
following endings.

| Personal pronoun | Verb "lavorare" |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Noi              | lavor - **iamo** |
| Voi              | lavor - **ate** |
| Loro             | lavor - **ano** |

When a verb stem ends with the letter "-i", such as studiare (studi) and
mangiare (mangi), we don't need to add another "-i" for the "Noi" form.
