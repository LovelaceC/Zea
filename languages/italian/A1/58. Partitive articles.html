# Partitive articles - A1 - Italian

In this unit, we are going to learn about **countable and uncontable nouns** and
**partitive articles**. Have a look at the sentence below; why do "latte",
"carne", "formaggio" and "acqua" not have a number?

- Per favore, puoi andare a comprare quattro uova, del **latte**, cinque carote
  della **carne**, del **formaggio** e dell'**acqua**?
- Could you go buy four eggs, some milk, five carrots, some meat, some cheese
  and some water, please?

**Countable nouns** are nouns which can be counted. They can have a singular or
a plural form and they always follow an indefinite / definite article or a
number ("**un** litro", "**quattro** uova", "**cinque** carote"). "Latte",
"carne", "formaggio" and "acqua" do not have a number because they are
**uncountable nouns** (i.e. we cannot count them).

- Compro dell'**acqua**.
- Lui mangia della **carne**.
- Posso avere del **latte**, per favore?

When talking about non-specific quantities, uncontable nouns usually follow
a **partitive article** (**della** carne, **del** formaggio, **dell'**acqua).
If we want to talk about a specific quantity of an uncountable noun, we use
units of measurements or other nouns followed by de preposition "di". Have
a look at the examples below:

- **del** latte (some milk) - un **litro di** latte - Una **bottiglia di** latte
- **della** farina (some flour) - mezzo **chilo di** farina (half a kilo of
flour) - un **pacco di** farina (a packet of flour)

Uncontable nouns are always singular, while countable nouns have a singular and
a plural form. Be **careful**, though! Some nouns can be countable or
uncountable **depending on the context**. Have a look at the example below:

- Countable: Mi porta **tre caffè** per favore?
  Can I have three coffees, please?

- Uncountable: Devo comprare **del caffè**.
  I need to buy some coffee.

So far, we've learned that uncountable nouns:

- Cannot be counted
- Are always singular
- Can follow a partitive article, a noun or a unit of measurement

Let's now concentrate on partitive articles.

**Partitive articles** indicate a non-specific quantity (some) of an uncountable
noun.

- **della** birra
- **dello** zucchero
- **dell'**acqua
- **del** pane

We form partitive articles exactly the same way we do with the "preposizione
articolata".

| Preposition | Partitive article |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| di + il | del |
| di + lo | dello |
| di + la | della |
| di + l' | dell' |
