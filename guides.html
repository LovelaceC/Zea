# Guides

In the subsections of the "Computer Science" section, you will find only theory.
In "_Guides_" you will find tutorials or entire guides that will help you to
create some projects.

Take in account that all the things shown here are for advanced C and Assembly
developers, so before trying to complete any of the guides here please refer to
the programming section so you can learn it beforehand.
