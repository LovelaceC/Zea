Extensibility is important, but emphasizing that importance is difficult if you
don't know the scope of possibilities in Emacs. I've included just a few
examples of what Emacs can do - or mor importantly still, what Emacs can enable
_people_ to do - here.

- **A speech interface for the blind**: For 20 years, Emacspeak has offered
blind or visually impaired Emacs users a way of interacting with Emacs, and the
world, through a speec interface that understands the content of what appears on
your screen. Emacspeak will change the voice characteristics of the peech engine
to reflect different syntatic elements in source code, or to emphasize layout,
fonts or graphical icons. For blind Emacs users, Emacspeak is a lifeline that
has enabled them to continue working by using Emacs' many tools, such as e-mail
or web browsing. The fact that this functionality has been around for 20 years
is in itself impressive, but Emacs' ability to support this sort of
transformational software is beyond inspiring.
- **Remote file editing**: Emacs' tramp (Transparent Remote - file - Access,
Multiple Protocol) seamlessly lets you edit remote files using a variety of
network protocols including SSH, FTP, rsyng, and more, as though the files were
local.
- **Shell access**: Emacs has a built-in ANSi-capable Terminal emulator; an
Emacs wrapper around shells, such as bash; and full-blown shell called _Eshell_
written entirely in elisp.
- **ORG mode**: A to-do, agenda, project planner, literate programming,
note-taking (and more!) application. It's widely considered _the best text-based
organiser ever_.
- **And much more**: Official or unofficial support for almost every programming
environment; built-in man page and info reader; a ver sophisticated directory
and file manager; seamless support for almost every major version control
system; browsing the web; IRC and Jabber chatting; and thousands of other
features, large or small.
