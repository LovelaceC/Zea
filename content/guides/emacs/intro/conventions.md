There are some important Emacs conventions that we need to talk about before
continuing. It's quite important that you memorize them or at least refer back
to this page if you are in doubt. They will crop up again and again in this
guide and elsewhere and knowing them is paramount if you want to make use of
Emacs' extensive, internal documentation. This is _not_ and exhaustive list of
conventions used in Emacs or even in this guide. I will introduce some terms
transcend specific topics and are therefore important to know beforehand.
