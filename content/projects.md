The followings are some of the projects I am currently working in:

* [Kinl](http://anonworld.eu:9095/cgit/Kinl)
* [AnonWorld](https://anonworld.eu)

## Kinl

Kinl (stands for Kinl Is Not Linux - as a reference to the GNU project) spelled
Kin**e**l is a completely-free (as in freedom and as in free beer) operating
system made from scratch in C and Assembly.

This is not a production-ready operating system, it is just made so I can
understand how computers actually work and test my abilities in the previously
mentioned programming languages.

Kinl is not just a kernel, is meant to be an entire operating system, it
contains some other sub-projecs as Klisp, Knet and some others. You can read
more about all of them in the readme file of its git repository.

## AnonWorld

AnonWorld is a completely-free (as in free beer - regretably it uses javascript
but its experience is not damaged if you use LibreJS) cracking and programming
school ran by some hacktivists from the anonymous collective.

I will be creating some courses there, it is completely free and there are
forums so you can learn with the other users as well.
