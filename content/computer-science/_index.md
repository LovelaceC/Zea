Welcome to the Computer Science category.

I love Computer Science, in fact, is one of those things that I am always
looking for things to learn, I want to know how everything works, regretably
it is not posible, but if we all get together we might understand a big portion
of it.

Each one of these sections is always willing to receive contributions, if you
know about something that is not here or if there is an error, I am open to
receive contributions.

Thank you.
