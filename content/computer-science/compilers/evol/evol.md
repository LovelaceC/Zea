The first electronic computers appeared in the 1940's and were programmed in
machine language by sequences of 0's and 1's that explicitly told the programmer
what operations to execute and in what order. The operations themselves were
very low level: move data from one location to another, add the contents of two
registers, compare two values, and so on. Needless to say, this kind of
programming was slow, tedious and error prone. And once written, the programs
were hard to understand and modify.
