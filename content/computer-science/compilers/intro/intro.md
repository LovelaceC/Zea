Programming languages are notations for describing computations to people and to
machines. The world as we know it depends on programming languages, because all
the software running on all the computers was written in some programming
language. But, before a program can be run, it first must be translated into a
form in which it can be executed by a computer.

The software systems that do this translation are called _compilers_.

This course is about how to design an implement compilers. We will discover that
a few basic ideas can be used to construct translators for a wide variety of
languages and machines. Besides compilers, the principles for compiler design
are applicable to so many other domains htat hey are likely to be reused many
times in the career of a computer scientist. The study of compiler writing
touches upon programming languages, machine architecture, language theory,
algorithms and software engineering.

In this preliminary section, we introduce the different forms of language
translators, give a high level overview of the structure of a typical compiler,
and discuss the trends in programming languages and machine architecture that
are shaping compilers. We include some observations on the relationship between
compiler design and computer-science theory and an outline of the brief outline
of key programming-language concepts that will be needed for our study of
compilers.
