Operating systems have been evolving through the years. In the following entries
we will briefly look at a few of the highlights. Since operating systems have
historically been closely tied to the architecture of the computers on which
they run, we will look at successive generations of computers to see what their
operating systems were like. This mapping of operating system generations to
computers is crude, but it does provide some structure where there would
otherwise be none.

The progression given below is largely chronological, but it has been a bumpy
ride. Each development did not wait until the previous one nicely finished
before getting started. There was a lot of overlap, not to mention many false
starts and dead ends. Take this as a guide, not as the last word.

The first true digital computer was designed by the English mathematician
Charles Babbage (1792-1871). Although Babbage spent most of his life and fortune
trying to build his "_analythical engine_", he never got it working properly
because it was purely mechanical, and the technology of his day could not
produce the required wheels, gears and cogs to the high precision that he
needed. Needless to say, the analytical engine did not have an operating system.

As an interesting historical aside, Babbage realised that we would need software
for his analytical engine, so he hired a young woman named Ada Lovelace, who was
the daughter of the famed British poet Lord Byron, as the world's first
programmer. The programming language Ada is named after her.
