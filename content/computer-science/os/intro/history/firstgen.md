After Babbage's unsuccessful efforts, little progress was made in constructing
digital computers until the World War II period, which stimulated an explosion
of activity. Professor John Atanasoff and his graduate student Clifford Berry
built what is now regarded as the first functioning digital computer at Iowa
State University. It used 300 vacuum tubes. At roughly the same time, Konrad
Zuse in Berlin built the Z3 computer out of electromechanical relays. In 1944,
the Colossus was built and programmed by a group of scientists (including Alan
Turing) at Bletchely Park, Englang, the Mark I was built by Howard Aiken at
Harvard, and the ENIAC was built by William Mauchley and his graduate student
J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania. Some were binary, some used
vacuum tubes, some were programmable, but all were very primitive and took
seconds to perform the simplest calculation.

In these days, a single group of people (usually engineers) designed, built,
programmed, operated and maintained each machine. All programming was done in
absolute machine language, or even worse yet, by wiring up electrical circuits
by connecting thousands of cables to plugboards to control the machine's basic
functions. Programming languages were unknown (even assemblt language was
unknown). Operating systems were unheard of. The usual mode of operation was for
the programmer to sign up for a block of time using the signup sheet on the
wall, then come down to the machine room, insert their plugboard into the
computer, and spend the next few hours hoping that none of the 20,000 or so
vacuum tubes would burn out during the run. Virtually, all the problems were
simple straightforward mathematical and numerical calculations, such as grinding
out tables of sines, cosines and logarithms, or computing artillery trajectories.
