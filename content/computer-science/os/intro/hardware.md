An operating system is intimately tied to the hardware of the computer it runs
on. It extends the computer's instruction set and manages its resources. To
work, it must know a great deal about the hardware, at least how the hardware
appears to the programmer. For this reason, let's birefly review computer
hardware as found in modern personal computers. After that, we can start getting
into the details of what operating systems do and how they work.

Conceptually, a simple personal computer can be abstracted to a model resembling
the image above. The CPU, memory and I/O devices are all connected by a system
bus and communicate with one another over it. Modern personal computers have a
more complicated structure, involving multiple buses, which we will look at
later. For the time being, this model will be sufficient. In the following
sections, we will briefly review these components and examine some of the
hardware issues that are of concern to operating system designers. Needless to
say, this will be a very compact summary. Many books have been written on the
subject of computer hardware and computer organisation.
