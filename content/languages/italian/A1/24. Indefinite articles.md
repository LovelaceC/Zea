We have learned before that there are four articles (un, uno, un', una) that
often come right before a noun.

Now let's learn how to use them.

There are two articles for masculine nouns: "**un**" and "**uno**". "**Uno**" is
by far the mos common. We only use "**uno**" in a few cases, such as when the
noun starts with "y" or "s" plus a consonant.

- Per me **un b**icchiere di vino rosso.
- Vorrei **uno yo**gurt.
- **Uno sp**umante, per favore.

There are also **two articles** for **feminine** nouns: "**un'**" and "**una**".
We use **un'** (with an apostrophe) for nouns starting with a vowel (a, e, i,
o, u) and we use "**una**" for all others.

- Per me **un'i**nsalata
- Vorrei **una b**ottiglia di acqua

Before we move on, let's recap these four articles:

Masculine

- **un**: un **b**icchiere
- **uno**: uno **sp**ritz, uno **yo**gurt

Feminine

- **una**: una **b**ottiglia
- **un'**: un'**a**ranciata
