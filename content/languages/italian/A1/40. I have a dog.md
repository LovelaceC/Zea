| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Il gatto | The cat |
| Il cane | The dog |

In Italian, for most animales we use one generic word for both female and male
animals. For instance, "**uccello**" (bird) refers to the female and the male.
Same for "**farfalla**" (butterfly). However, with pets like cats and dogs we
sometimes differentiate "**gatto**" is male for cat and "**gatta**" is female.

For cane, if we want to talk about the female we would say "**cagnolina**",
which is a cute way of talking about a female dog. "**Cagnolino**" and
"**Cagnolina**" literally mean male puppy and female puppy.
