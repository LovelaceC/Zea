In this unit, you will learn the **demonstrative pronouns**. While demonstrative
adjectives are always followed by a noun, we use demonstrative pronouns to
replace a noun. Have a look at the examples below: In the first sentence you see
a demonstrative adjective followed by a noun, while, in the second the noun is
replaced by a **demonstrative pronoun**.

- Questo giornale è di ieri. **Quello** è di oggi
- Quell'accendino è mio. **Questo** è tuo
- Quelle brose sono verdi. **Questa** è grigia

Demonstrative pronouns match in gender and number with the noun they replace. We
use "**questo**" and "**quello**" for masculine singular nouns, and "**questa**"
and "**quella**" for feminine singular nouns.

We use "**questi**" and "**quelli**" for masculine plural nouns, and
"**queste**" and "**quelle**" for feminine plural nouns.

Have you noticed? The demonstrative pronouns are almost the same as the
demonstrative adjectives. The only differences are that:

- Demonstrative pronouns **do not have contracted forms** with an
apostrophe, like "**quest**" and "**quell**"

- When we talk about someting further away, there is only one demonstrative
pronoun for masculine singular nouns: "**quello**" (we don't use "quel") and
one for masculine plural nouns "**quelli**" (not "quei" or "quegli").
