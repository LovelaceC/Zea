Can you speak more than one language? Are you learning another language
alongside italian?

To answer these questions (actually, to form most sentences in Italian) you need
definite articles

In this lesson, we will focus on the three masculine singular articles: lo, l'
and il.

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Imparo l'italiano e lo spagnolo su Zea | I'm learning Italian and Spanish on Zea |

We have already seen some adjectives to describe nationalities of things and
people like "tedesco/tedesca" and "cinese".

For language names, we simply use the male nationality adjectives.

We use definite articles to indicate a specific noun, namely a particular person
animal or thing (such as a language).

We use the article l' before all nouns starting with a vowel.

One of the reasons why italian flows nicely is because we pronounce words like
l'inglese and l'arabo as a single word.

We use the article "lo" in a few cases, for instance when the name of the
language begins with the letter "s" followed by a consonant.

Finally, for all languages that do not start with a vowel nor with "s" plus a
consonant, we use the article "il".
