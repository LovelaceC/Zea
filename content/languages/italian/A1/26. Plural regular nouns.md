You might not have a sweet tooth, but if you are passing by an italian
pasticceria (patisserie) you'll find it hard to resist the many treats on
display. In this lesson, we are going to find out about another institution of
italian food culture and learn the plural forms of some nouns.

- Due **pasticcini**, grazie (Two pastries, thanks)
- Vorrei due fette di torta al cioccolato (I'd like two slices of chocolate
cake)

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Una pasticceria | A patisserie |

We have learned that most nouns ending in "**-o**" are masculine. To form their
plural form, we simply need to replace the final "**-o**" with an "**-i**".

- Cornetto -> Tre cornetti
- Cappuccino -> Tre cappuccini

We have also learned that most nouns ending with "**-a**" are feminine. To form
their plural form, we replace the final "**-a**" with an "**-e**".

- Fetta (slice) -> Tre fette
- Torta (Cake) -> Due torte

Finally, nouns ending with an accented vowel (à, è, ì, o, ù) can be either
masculine or feminine - so we need to look them up! Regardless of their gender,
plural and singular forms are identical.

- Caffè -> Quattro caffè
- Tiramisu -> Tre tiramisù

Here's a quick recap:

| Gender | Singular | Plural |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Masculine | Cappuccin**o** | Cappuccin**i** |
| Feminine | Tort**a** | Tort**e** |
| Masculine and feminine | Caffè | Caffè |
