As you might already know, cibo e famiglia (food and family) are at the core of
Italian culture. The mamma (mom) is sacred and no restaurant beats the food
cooked by the nonna (grandma)

In this lesson, you'll learn a few words to talk about your family.

| Italian | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Mia madre | My mother | Mia madre si chiama Angela |
| Mio padre | My father | Mio padre si chiama Giovanni |

To talk about someone's name, we say _si chiama_ (he/she is called). We use this
for both women and men.

We use _mia_ before a feminine noun and _mio_ before a masculine noun.

- Mia madre
- Mio padre

| Italian | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Mia nonna | My grandmother | Mia nonna si chiama Sofia |
| Mio nonno | My grandfather | Mio nonno si chiama Vittorio |
| Mio marito | My husband | Mio marito si chiama Antonio |
| Mia moglie | My wife | Mia moglie si chiama Lucia |
