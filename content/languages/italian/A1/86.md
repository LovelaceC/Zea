In this unit we are going to learn some expressions of time that we can use to
talk about the present and the future. They will come handy soon when we learn
how to use the present tense to talk about the future.

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| Oggi | Today |
| Adesso / Ora | Now |
| Dopo | Later |
| Domani | Tomorrow |
| Dopodomani | The day after tomorrow |

When we talk about next week, next year, etcetera, we use the word "**prossimo /
prossima**" (next) before or after the word we are describing.

- la prossima settimana / la settimana prossima.
- il prossimo anno / l'anno possimo
- il prossimo mese / il mese prossimo

| Italian | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| La prossima settimana | Next week |
| Stamattina | This morning |
| Stasera | This evening |

"**Stamattina**" and "**stasera**" are the shortened forms of "questa mattina"
and "questa sera", which are slightly more formal and less common.
