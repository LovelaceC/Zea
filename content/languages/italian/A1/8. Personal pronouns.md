In this lesson we'll revise how to say "I" and "You" and we'll learn how to say
"he" and "she".

Words like io (I) and tu (you) are called personal pronouns. We use them to
indicate the person we are talking about: either ourselves or someone else.

Io sono Ali, e tu? (I'm Ali, and you?)

- lei (she)
- lui (he)

We use "lei" for a woman and "lei" for a man.

These four personal pronouns are called singular because they refer to only
one person.

When it's clear who are we talking about, we can often skip the personal
pronouns.

Io sono russa -> Sono russa (I'm Russian)
Tu sei americano? -> Sei americano? (Are you American?)

In the next lesson, we will learn how to use these pronouns with the verb
"essere" (to be) to build many new sentences.

- io, tu, lui, lei (I, you, he, she)
