In this section, we are going to start talking about Client-Side Attacks. So,
most of the time it is better to try to gain access to your target using the
Server-Side Attacks. So, try to find exploits in the operating system and in the
applications installed, if you tried that and it didn't work or if you target is
hidden behind an IP, if our target is not in the same network as us, or if they
are using a network, if you ping their IP and you are not able to reach it then
your next resort is going to be the Client-Side Attacks.

These attacks require the user to do something, the user is going to have to
open a link, they are going to have to install an update, they are going to have
to open a picture, etcetera. They have to interact, they have to do something
and once they do it, we will be able to run code and achieve our goal.
Therefore, as it requires user interaction, information gathering is very
important in this case and we don't only need to get information about the
installed applications, we also need to know the person, we need to know their
friends, we need to know the networks they use, the websites they use, if there
is any website that they frequently use and trust.

That is why, the information gathering in this section is going to be focused on
the person, rather than focused on the applications and the operating system.
