Hello everybody, I am Bassara and this is the Zea Banger project (yes, I know
the name sucks).

This is a project I decided to start to help people willing to learn about
computer science or to take their programming and hacking abilities to the next
level.

Here you can find a lot of different things for free, as in freedom and as in
free beer (for more info see [Philosophy](/philosophy)).

**Is all this content for free?**

Yes, it is. You can access all the entries in this website and even modify its
source code or create derivative projects for free, there are a few
[conditions](/philosophy) to that. I decided to gather all the information in
this website to help people who has not the resources to buy books or online
courses, is not completely sure if this is what they want to study or just this
is something they don't want to spend money on.

You can donate [here](/donate) to support this project and you can also
contribute material [in this git repository](https://codeberg.org/Bassara/Zea).

Take in account that English is not my first language, and I might commit some
errors, if you want to fix them you are completely free to contribute changes to
Zea.

**Are you an expert?**

Nope, I am not I am just somebody who is passionate about technology and
programming, I have never been in college or studied formally the things shown
in this website, I learned from books, courses, and experts.
