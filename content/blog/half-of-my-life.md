Yesterday it was my 16th birthday, and I realised I have been involved with
programming and - basically computer stuff - for eight years, that is, half of
my life now. How did everything happened? Well...

I remember I was one day sitting on my computer and that day, one of my cousins
came home and told me "Look at this video I saw in YouTube, it teaches you to
create websites" and I was like "ohhh that's so interesting, show me" and from
there on... My addiction began... my addiction to learn, my addiction to read.
It brought much more than website-creation knowledge to my life.

It began creating simple websites using plain HTML, learn how to add links, how
to add images, and now I am learning about a lot of stuff, how computers work,
hacking, microembedded device programming, it literally changed my life. I ask
to myself from time to time how different my life would have been if I never
watched that video, if my cousing didn't go to my house and a lot of other
things that could have changed everything for me.

I am so thankful for all the things this hobby has brought to me, all the people
I have met throughout the way, all the projects I have started, all the projects
that I haven't finished (all of them, sadly) and all the times I've had a hard
time trying to fix an "impossible" to fix error, but it was just a missing
semicolon.

If you are reading this, you are probably part of my story... And if you are
not, what are you waiting for? I am anxious to get to know you :3.
