Let's have some background about the problem we are trying to solve.

Let's suppose you have a C application running, and you have called some
malloc/kalloc/free functions to manage memory. When your application calls
such functions for either allocate or deallocate memory, that request goes
to the operating system and the operating system serves that request and as
a result the memory is returned to the application so it can use it.

Those are the basic three steps which are involved when a C application
requests memory from the operating system.

When the operating system returns a response, for example, when `malloc` is
called it will return the return the address of memory that is allocated for our
C program.

Now let's start to understand what our program will be.

Now the memory allocation requests/responses will be handled by a third party,
our program so, when a C application requests for memory allocation/deallocation
that request will now be made to the MLD library rather than the Operating
System, when the MLD library that we are going to develop receives a request
will forward that request to the operating system, the OS will response to the
MLD library as it normally would. Now the MLD library, depending on the response
received from the operating system, the MLD library will update its internal
data structures to keep track of memory objects that are used by the C program
and finally it will return the memory to the C program so it can use it.

Now the memory allocation/deallocation requests are handled in five steps rather
than three as described before:

1. Request memory to the MLD Library.
2. The MLD Library forwards the memory request to the OS.
3. The memory request is served and the OS returns an answer to the MLD library.
4. The MLD Library updates its internal data structures to keep track of the
memory objects used by the application.
5. The MLD Library returns the memory to the C program so it can be used.

The MLD library acts as a middleman between the C program and the operating
system, for example, let's suppose you request 10 bytes of memory, this request
of memory allocation of 10 bytes will go from the C program to the MLD library
first and then, it will forward that request to the operating system, the
operating system will return a response to the MLD library, the MLD library
once receives the response from the operating system will update its internal
data structures which it has created in order to keep track of all the memory
objects that are used by the application and finally, when the MLD library is
done building its internal data structure, the MLD library will return the 10
bytes chunk of memory back to the C program so it can be used by it.
