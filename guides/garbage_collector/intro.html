**Note**: I assume you are already familiar with what memory leak is.

This series of tutorials will guide through the creation of a MLD (Memory Leak
Detection) tool, and a tool like this will be able to find if our application is
leaking memory or not (You can see what a memory leak is
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)).

By the end, you will be able to implement this "project" as a library and let it
manage the memory for you.

How is it going to work? It is going to keep track of all the heap objects that
our program has created and it will also keep track of how they hold references
to each other and it will show you the leaked objects (if any).
