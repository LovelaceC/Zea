**Note**: This based in the way RMS did it on his
[page](https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html).

Before I start writing this, **I don't have a favourite this or that**, I don't
have a favourite anything, that's not how my tastes work, for me, there are a
lot of things that I like and the scale of how much I like them depends on so
many variables, that's why, I can't say that I have a favourite something, but
sometimes it is just easier to make up I list of things that I remember so I
don't have to explain this to people every time.

## Music

* Music genres I like are jazz, swing, easy listening, blues, industrial meta,
spanish rap, folk, country, tango and grunge. Singes/groups I like a lot are
Dino, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Perry Como, Ella Fitzgerald,
Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darin, Nat King, Giulia y Los Tellarini, Bing Crosby,
Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, The Irish Rovers, Manuel Medrano, Luis
Miguel, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Peggy Lee, Canserbero, El Chojin,
ZPU, Billie Holiday, Sara Vaughan, Nina Simone, Angus and Julia Stone, Liana
Malva, JUNG, Nirvana, Bing Crosby and several other I cannot think of right now.
* I know the lyrics of almost every song I usually listen to, because if I don't
I can't focus, I need to sing while listening to the music (Ironically, that
helps me a lot to get focuse).
* I do almost everything while listening to the music, otherwise, I will get
bored so fast (actually, while I am writing this, I am listening to the music).

## Books

* I am almost all the time reading a book.
* Even though I have read a lot and I am always reading something, I am so bad
at recommending books.
* Genres I like the most are romance, mistery, horror, programming, computer
science, philosophy, psichology, cybersecurity books and politics.

## Food

* I am an omnivore.
* I don't like alcohol, it tastes horrible and it makes you stupid.

## Religion

* I am an atheist.
* I don't follow any religion.
* I love the LaVeyan philosophy, but when I am asked about my religion I will
not even mention this, as I think people will think I am just seeking for
attention.
* "There's more wisdom on doubt, than infinite knowledge".

## Clothing


* I don’t have a “clothing style”.
* Actually, I don’t care that much about the things I wear on, I simply take the
first clothes I find (if they are clean, obviously) and I put them on.

## Surveillance Issues

* I hate the fact of carrying a phone with me all the time.
* See below: "How I do my computing".

## Holidays

* I don’t like holidays, I don’t like christmas or those new year celebrations.

## Languages


* I speak three languages: Spanish, English and Italian.
* The way I learn new languages is:
* First, I learn words in that language and try to form simple sentences using
them.
* Then, I learn some grammar rules and try to apply them in the sentences I
wrote beforehand.
* When I can understand a bit of that language, I will start reading books for
children, each time I see an unknown word I will take a dictionary, search for
its definition and try to write down five/seven sentences using that word.
* Once I feel comfortable using that language, I will start watching videos,
documentaries and listening to podcasts in that language.
* Finally, when I feel confident enough using that language, I will look for
natives to practise it.

# How I do my computing?

## My computer

I use an Asus X441N, which runs a free operating system (Trisquel).

## GNU/Linux distro

I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.

I’ve been using Debian, Arch and Gentoo based distributions for a long time,
I got used to them. I’ve also tried Void and Fedora, but didn’t like them
that much.

I usually switch between Debian, Arch and Gentoo.

## What I do on my computer

I am almost all the time working on a project, reading a book or watching
videos. I have a lot of books downloaded on my computer, such as the emacs and
gdb manual, MINIX, some others about programming (NASM, C and Perl) and also
some hacking and politics books.

When I am not working on any project, reading a book or watching videos, I am
hacking my computer, modifying things, testing window managers, opening,
reading, moving and copying files, create little programs in programming
languages I am learning, practise things using my flashcards in Anki, and that
sort of things.

# Facts about me

* I hate languages like Python, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript (even though I learned
it before, and my level is intermediate/advanced).
* I refuse to drink anything from CocaCola. I hate that company.
* I have several mental disorders :).
