# Zea

This is Zea.

This is basically a place where I post things I learn, there are notes about
computer science, operating systems, compilers, interpreters, programming,
cybersecurity, hacking and several other things. I hope all of this can help
you.

## Operating systems

I have been involved with operating system development in the past, it is such a
hard task to do, if you decide to try so it means you are a masochist and pain
makes you horny, like me.

There are several good resources out there such as the os-dev wiki, anyway, I
decided to put some things about it in this website, you can explore it in the
Computer Science section.

## Programming

I am always reading a book about programming, enrolled in a course or something
like that, I will post things there regularly about things I learn, things I
don't want to forget, or simply things that I think could be helpful for other
people.

## Hacking

In this section there is nothing about cybersecurity, please don't use the term
"Hacking" or "Hacker" when talking about somebody who cracked into a something
or a person that is good breaking security, those are either pentesters or
cybercriminals.

Here you will find things about kernel hacking, linux drivers development,
arduino/raspberry pi hacking and several other things.

## About Me

This is probably the most boring section of all, as there is just information
about me.

## Philosophy

Learn about my philosophy, free software, anarchism and all those things that
are in my mind.

## Good Reads

A place where I will post regularly books I would recommend you to read.
