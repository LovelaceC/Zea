All the content posted here is free (_as in freedom_), I have no trackers, no
ads or no other way I could get any revenue for the people visiting my website.
I don't do any of this for money, that's why I don't charge a single penny for
anything, but if you want to support what I do, you can either contribute code
or money. You can do the first option in
[this repository](https://codeberg.org/Bassara/Zea) or you can donate through
PayPal (I discourage you from using this method as it requires non-free
javascript) or through liberapay:

- Paypal:

<input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="USD" />
